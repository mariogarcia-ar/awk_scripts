#!/usr/bin/awk -f

# If awk's index() function is returning incorrect positions when processing a UTF-8 encoded 
# file but works correctly after converting the file to Windows-1252 encoding, it's likely 
# because index() counts bytes rather than characters. Since UTF-8 characters can consist of 
# multiple bytes, their positions can be misinterpreted when using index() directly on UTF-8 text.

# Convert the file to Windows-1252 encoding before processing: This approach ensures that index() 
# behaves as expected since Windows-1252 characters are single-byte encoded.

# iconv -f UTF-8 -t WINDOWS-1252 filename | awk '{
#     # Your AWK script here
#     print $0  # For example, print each line
# }'

    # Loop through each occurrence of monetary value in the input line
