Certainly! Let's break down how the modified script works:

1. `#!/usr/bin/awk -f`: This is a shebang line specifying the interpreter (`awk`) to execute the script.

2. `FNR == NR`: This condition checks if the record number (`FNR`) is equal to the overall record number (`NR`). When `FNR == NR`, it means `awk` is processing the first file.

3. `{ lines[$0] = 1; next }`: This block is executed only for the first file. It reads each line of the first file and stores it as a key in the associative array `lines`. The value `1` is arbitrary, indicating that the line exists in the first file. The `next` statement skips processing the rest of the script and moves on to the next line.

4. For the second file:
   - If the record number of the current line (`FNR`) is not equal to the overall record number (`NR`), it means `awk` is processing the second file.
   - For each line in the second file, if the line does not match any line in the `lines` array (i.e., it does not exist in the first file), it is printed. This is achieved by the expression `!($0 in lines)`, which returns true when the line is not found in the `lines` array.

This script will output the lines that are present only in the second file, effectively printing the differences between the two files.
