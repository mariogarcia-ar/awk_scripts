Certainly! Let's break down how the script works:

1. `#!/usr/bin/awk -f`: This is known as a shebang line. It tells the shell to execute this script using the `awk` interpreter located at `/usr/bin/awk` with the `-f` option.

2. `FNR == NR`: This condition checks if the record number (line number) `FNR` in the current file is equal to the overall record number `NR`. In awk, `NR` represents the total record number across all files being processed, while `FNR` represents the record number in the current file. When `FNR == NR`, it means awk is processing the first file.

3. `{ lines[$0] = 1; next }`: This block is executed only for the first file. It reads each line of the first file and stores it as a key in the associative array `lines`. The value `1` is arbitrary; we're just using it to indicate that the line exists in the first file. The `next` statement skips processing the rest of the script and moves on to the next line.

4. `$0 in lines { print }`: This block is executed for the second file. It checks if the current line (`$0`) exists as a key in the `lines` array, meaning it's also present in the first file. If it does, it prints the line.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the script works when processing both files:

- For the first file (`file1.txt`):
  - Each line is read and stored as a key in the `lines` array.

- For the second file (`file2.txt`):
  - Each line is checked against the `lines` array. If the line exists in `lines`, it's printed.

The result is that only lines common to both files are printed to the output.
